## Requirements

Install trunk, see  <https://trunkrs.dev/> for instructions. A Github token is also required,
e.g. the Github CLI can be use to get acccess to one for local testing:


```bash
gh auth token
```


## How to run

```bash
GH_TOKEN="xxx" trunk serve --open
```

This will open a browser with the web page.
